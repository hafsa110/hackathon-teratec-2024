\chapter{Inputs and outputs}
\label{ch:inp:outp}

\section{Preliminary remarks}

A set of files is used by \telemac{2D} as input or output.
Some files are optional.

The input files are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item The steering file (\textbf{mandatory}), containing the configuration
of the computation,

\item The geometry file (\textbf{mandatory}), containing the mesh,

\item The boundary conditions file (\textbf{mandatory}), containing the
description of the type of each boundary,

\item The previous computation file, which can give the initial state of the
computation (case of a restart computation).
This is an optional file,

\item The bottom topography file, containing the elevation of the bottom.
Generally, the topographic data are already available in the
geometry file and the bottom topography file is generally not used,
%no longer useful,

\item The reference file, which contains the ``reference'' results
and is used in the frame of a validation procedure,

\item The liquid boundaries file, containing information about the prescribed
values at the open boundaries (elevation, flowrate\dots),

\item The FORTRAN file, containing the specific programming,

\item The friction data file, which contains information about the
configuration of the bottom friction when this configuration is complex,

\item The stage-discharge curves file, which contains information on the liquid
boundaries where the characteristics are prescribed according to specific
elevation/flowrate laws,

\item The sources file, containing information about the sources,

\item The sections input file, which contains the description of the control
sections of the model (sections across which the flowrate is computed),

\item The oil spill steering file, which contains all the parameters necessary
to the simulation of an oil spill event.
See section \ref{sec:oil:spill:modell} for more details,

\item The tidal model file, which contains data used for tide simulation.
See section \ref{subs:tidal:harm:datab} for more details,

\item The ASCII database for tide,

\item The binary database 1 and 2 for tide files,

\item The weirs data file which contains all needed parameters related to weirs,

\item The culverts data file,

%\item The tubes (or bridges) data file

\item The breaches data file which contains the characteristics of the breaches
initiation and growth.
See section \ref{sec:dykes},

\item The drogues file, which contains the parameters for drogues creation and
release.
See section \ref{sec:drog:displ},

\item The zones file which contains the description of friction zones, or any
other zone,

\item The time series coordinates file 1 and 2 which contain coordinates and
periods of time where time series are extracted and written in the time series
file 1 and 2.

%\item The water quality steering file which contains the parameters used by the newly added water quality module of \telemac{2D}. This feature is completely independent of the water quality handled by DELWAQ. See Chapter \ref{ch:wat:qual}

%\item Water quality dictionary which contains all the key-words dedicated exclusively to the water quality module.
\end{itemize}



The output files are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item The results file, containing the graphical results,

\item The listing printout, which is the ``log file'' of the computation.
If necessary, the user can get additional information in this file by activating
the integer keyword \telkey{DEBUGGER} (default value = 0) in the
\telkey{STEERING FILE}.
\telkey{DEBUGGER} = 1 will show the sequence of calls to subroutines in the main
program \telfile{TELEMAC2D}.
This is useful in case of crash, to locate the guilty subroutine,

\item The sections output file, which contains the results of the
``control sections'' computation,

\item The restart file, allowing to perform a restart computation without
information loss,

\item The time series file 1 and 2 which contain time series at locations
defined in the time series coordinates file 1 and 2.
\end{itemize}

In addition, the user can manage additional files:

\begin{itemize}
\item 2 binary data files (input),

\item 2 formatted data files (input),

\item 1 binary results file (output),

\item 1 formatted results file (output).
\end{itemize}

Some of these files are used by \telemac{2D} for specific applications.

Some others files are also required when coupling \telemac{2D} with the water
quality software DELWAQ.
These files are described in appendix 4.


\subsection{Binary files format}
\label{subs:binfile}

The binary files managed inside the TELEMAC system can have various formats.
The most commonly used format is the SERAFIN format (also known as SELAFIN),
the TELEMAC system internal standard format (described in appendix 3).
This SERAFIN format can be configured in order to store real data
as single or double precision.
The other available format is the MED format which is compatible with
the SALOME platform jointly developed by EDF and CEA.
The full description of the MED format is available on the SALOME website
http://www.salome-platform.org.

Depending on the specified format, the binary file can be read by different
tools.
FUDAA-PREPRO and Blue Kenue can also read double precision.

The selection of the appropriate format is done using the corresponding keyword.
For example, the keyword \telkey{GEOMETRY FILE FORMAT} manages the format
of the geometry file.
Each keyword can take 3 different values (8 characters string): 'SERAFIN ' means
the single precision SERAFIN format and is the default (and recommended)
value (do not forget the space at the end),
'SERAFIND' is the double precision SERAFIN format which can be used
for more accurate ''computation continued'' or more accurate validation,
and `MED     ' means the MED HDF5 format.

The keywords involved are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \telkey{BINARY ATMOSPHERIC DATA FILE FORMAT},

\item \telkey{BINARY DATA FILE 1 FORMAT},

\item \telkey{BINARY DATA FILE 2 FORMAT},

\item \telkey{BINARY RESULTS FILE FORMAT},

\item \telkey{GEOMETRY FILE FORMAT},

\item \telkey{PREVIOUS COMPUTATION FILE FORMAT},

\item \telkey{REFERENCE FILE FORMAT},

\item \telkey{RESTART FILE FORMAT},

\item \telkey{RESULTS FILE FORMAT},

\item \telkey{TIDAL MODEL FILE FORMAT},

\item \telkey{TIME SERIES FILE 1 FORMAT},

\item \telkey{TIME SERIES FILE 2 FORMAT}.
\end{itemize}


\section{The files}


\subsection{The steering file}

This is a text file created by a text editor or by the FUDAA-PREPRO software
(but generally, the user starts from an already existing parameter file available
in the TELEMAC structure, for example in the test cases directories).

In a way, it represents the control panel of the computation.
It contains a number of keywords to which values are assigned.
All keywords are defined in a ``dictionary'' file which is specific to each
simulation module.
If a keyword is not contained in this file, \telemac{2D} will assign it
the default value defined in the dictionary file of in the appropriate FORTRAN
subroutine (see description in section \ref{subs:dico:file}).
If such a default value is not defined in the dictionary file,
the computation will stop with an error message.
For example, the command \telkey{TIME STEP = 10} enables the user to specify
that the computational time step is 10 seconds.

\telemac{2D} reads the steering file at the beginning of the computation.

The dictionary file and steering file are read by a utility called \damo,
which is included in \tel.
Because of this, when the steering file is being created, it is necessary
to comply with the rules of syntax used in \damo.
They are briefly described below.

The rules of syntax are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item The keywords may be of Integer, Real, Logical or Character type,

\item The order of keywords in the steering file is of no importance,

\item Each line is limited to 72 characters.
However, it is possible to pass from one line to the next as often as required,
provided that the name of the keyword is not split between two lines,

\item For keywords of the array type, the separator between two values is the
semi-colon.
It is not necessary to give a number of values equal to the size of the array.
In this case, \damo returns the number of read values. For example:
\end{itemize}

 \telkey{TYPE OF ADVECTION = 1;5}

 (this keyword is declared as an array of 4 values)

\begin{itemize}
\item The signs ":" or "=" can be used indiscriminately as separator
for the name of a keyword and its value.
They may be preceded or followed by any number of spaces.
The value itself may appear on the next line. For example:
\end{itemize}

 \telkey{TIME STEP =   10. }

or

 \telkey{TIME STEP: 10.}

or again

 \telkey{TIME STEP =}
\[10.\]

\begin{itemize}
\item Characters between two "/" on a line are considered as comments.
Similarly, characters between a "/" and the end of line are also considered as
comments.
For example:
\end{itemize}

 \telkey{TURBULENCE MODEL = 3}     / Model K-Epsilon

\begin{itemize}
\item A line beginning with "/" in the first column is considered to be all
comment, even if there is another "/" in the line. For example:
\end{itemize}

 / The geometry file is ./mesh/geo

\begin{itemize}
\item When writing integers, do not exceed the maximum size permitted by the
computer (for a computer with 32-bit architecture, the extreme values are
-2 147 483 647 to + 2 147 483 648.
Do not leave any space between the sign (optional for the +) and number.
A full stop (.) is allowed at the end of a number,

\item When writing real numbers, the full stop and comma are accepted
as decimal points, as are E and D formats of FORTRAN.
( 1.E-3  0.001  0,001  1.D-3 represent the same value),

\item When writing logical values, the following are acceptable:
1 OUI  YES  .TRUE.  TRUE  VRAI and 0 NON  NO  .FALSE.  FALSE  FAUX,

\item Character strings including spaces or reserved symbols
("/",":", "=", "\&") must be placed between apostrophes (').
The value of a character keyword can contain up to 144 characters.
As in FORTRAN, apostrophes in a string must be doubled.
A string cannot begin or end with a space. For example:
\end{itemize}

\telkey{TITLE = 'CASE OF GROYNE'}

In addition to keywords, a number of instructions or meta-commands interpreted
during sequential reading of the steering file can also be used:

\begin{itemize}
\item Command \telkey{\&FIN} indicates the end of the file
(even if the file is not finished).
This means that certain keywords can be deactivated simply by placing them
behind this command in order to reactivate them easily later on.
However, the computation continues,

\item Command \telkey{\&ETA} prints the list of keywords and the value
that is assigned to them when \damo encounters the command.
This will be displayed at the beginning of the listing printout,

\item Command \telkey{\&LIS} prints the list of keywords.
This will be displayed at the beginning of the listing printout,

\item Command \telkey{\&IND} prints a detailed list of keywords.
This will be displayed at the beginning of the listing printout,

\item Command \telkey{\&STO} stops the program and the computation is
interrupted.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{The geometry file}

This is a binary file.
The format of this file is given by the keyword \telkey{GEOMETRY FILE FORMAT}.
There are 3 possibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item SERAFIN: classical single precision format in \tel,
\item SERAFIND: classical double precision format in \tel,
\item MED: MED double precision format based on HDF5.
\end{itemize}

If it is a SERAFIN-formatted binary file, it can be read by
Paraview, FUDAA-PREPRO, Tecplot 360, Blue Kenue or RUBENS
and can either be generated by Janet, Blue Kenue or MATISSE,
or by the \stbtel module (from the file(s) originating from of mesh generator).
The SERAFIN format structure is described in Appendix \ref{sec:srffmt}.

If it is a MED-formatted binary file, it can be read by
Paraview only and can be generated by SALOME-HYDRO
or by the \stbtel module (from the file(s) originating from of mesh generator).

This file contains all the information concerning the mesh,
i.e. the number of mesh points (\telfile{NPOIN} variable),
the number of elements (\telfile{NELEM} variable),
the number of nodes per element (\telfile{NDP} variable),
arrays \telfile{X} and \telfile{Y} containing the coordinates of all the nodes
and array \telfile{IKLE} containing the connectivity table.

This file can also contain bottom topography information and/or
friction coefficient or friction ID at each mesh point.

\telemac{2D} stores information on the geometry at the start of the results file.
Because of this, the computation results file can be used as a geometry file
if a new simulation is to be run on the same mesh.

The name of this file is given with the keyword \telkey{GEOMETRY FILE}.


\subsection{The boundary conditions file}

This is a formatted file generated automatically by most of the mesh generators
compatible with \tel (Janet, Blue Kenue, MATISSE),
but also by FUDAA-PREPRO or \stbtel.
It can be modified using FUDAA-PREPRO or a standard text editor.
Each line of the file is dedicated to one point on the mesh boundary.
The numbering used for points on the boundary is that of the file lines.
First of all, it describes the contour of the domain trigonometrically,
starting from the bottom left-hand corner (X + Y minimum) and then the islands
in a clockwise direction.

See section \ref{sub:bc:file} for a fuller description of this file.

The file name is given with the keyword \telkey{BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FILE}.


\subsection{The FORTRAN user file}
\label{subs:FORT:user:file}
Since release 5.0 of the software (the first release to be written in
FORTRAN 90), this file has become optional, as \telemac{2D} uses
a dynamic memory allocation process and it is therefore no longer necessary
to set the size of the various arrays in the memory.

The \telkey{FORTRAN FILE} contains all the \telemac{2D} subroutines modified
by the user and those that have been specially developed for the computation.

This file is compiled and linked so as to generate the executable program
for the simulation.

The name of this file is given with the keyword \telkey{FORTRAN FILE}.


\subsection{The liquid boundaries file}

This text file enables the user to specify values for time-dependent boundary
conditions (flow rate, depth, velocity, and tracers' concentration).

See section \ref{subs:val:funct:bf} for a complete description of this file.

The file name is specified with the keyword \telkey{LIQUID BOUNDARIES FILE}.


\subsection{The sources file}

This text file enables the user to specify values for time-dependent conditions
for sources (discharge, tracers' concentration).

See Chapter \ref{ch:manag:ws} for a complete description of this file.

The file name is specified with the keyword \telkey{SOURCES FILE}.


\subsection{The friction data file}

This text file enables the user to configure the bottom friction
(used law and associated friction coefficient) in the domain.
These information can vary from one zone to another.

The file name is specified with the keyword: \telkey{FRICTION DATA FILE}
but is used only if the logical keyword \telkey{FRICTION DATA} is activated
(default = NO).

By default, the number of friction domains is limited to 10 but can be modified
using the keyword \telkey{MAXIMUM NUMBER OF FRICTION DOMAINS}.

See Appendix \ref{tel2d:app5} for a complete description of this file.


\subsection{The stage-discharge or elevation-discharge curves file}

This text file enables the user to configure the evolution of the prescribed
value on specific open boundaries.
This file is used when the prescribed elevation is determined
by a elevation/discharge law.
The descriptions of the appropriate laws are given through this file.
See section \ref{subs:stage:dis:curve} for a complete description of this file.

The file name is specified with the keyword \telkey{STAGE-DISCHARGE CURVES FILE}.


\subsection{The sections input file}

This text file enables the user to configure the control sections used
during the simulation.

See section \ref{sec:contr:sect} for a complete description of this file.

The file name is specified with the keyword: \telkey{SECTIONS INPUT FILE}.


\subsection{Files dedicated to construction works}

When using specific treatment of singularity (weirs, culverts, breaches), these
files are used to specify the elements necessary for the concerned treatment.
The keywords identifying these files are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \telkey{WEIRS DATA FILE},

%\item \telkey{TUBES DATA FILE},

\item \telkey{CULVERTS DATA FILE},

\item \telkey{BREACHES DATA FILE}.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{The reference file}

During the validation step of a calculation, this file contains the reference
result.
At the end of the calculation, the result of the simulation is compared to the
last time step stored in this file. The result of the comparison is given in
the control printout in the form of a maximum difference in depth,
the two velocity components and other variables such as $k$, $\epsilon$ and
tracers.

The name of this file is given by the keyword \telkey{REFERENCE FILE} and its
format is specified by the keyword \telkey{REFERENCE FILE FORMAT} (default
value: 'SERAFIN '), see subsection \ref{subs:binfile}.


\subsection{The results file}

This is the file in which \telemac{2D} stores information during the computation.
It is normally in SERAFIN (single precision) format.
It contains first of all information on the mesh geometry,
then the names of the stored variables.
It then contains the time for each time step and the values of the different
variables for all mesh points.

Its content depends on the value of the following keywords:
\begin{itemize}
\item \telkey{NUMBER OF FIRST TIME STEP FOR GRAPHIC PRINTOUTS}:
this is used to determine at what time step information is first to be stored,
so as to avoid having excessively large files, especially when a period of
stabilization precedes a transient simulation,

\item \telkey{GRAPHIC PRINTOUT PERIOD}:
fixes the period for outputs so as to avoid having an excessively large file.
Default value is 1 (writing at every time step).
In addition, whatever the output period indicated by the user,
the last time step is systematically saved,

\item \telkey{VARIABLES FOR GRAPHIC PRINTOUTS}:
this is used to specify the list of variables to be stored in the results file.
Each variable is identified by a symbol (capital letter of the alphabet
or mnemonic of no more than 8 characters);
these are listed in the description of this keyword in the Reference Manual.

% \telkey{OUTPUT OF INITIAL CONDITIONS} : this is used to specify whether the initial conditions for the calculation (time step 0) should be written in the results file. The default value for this keyword is YES.

\end{itemize}

The name of this file is given with the keyword \telkey{RESULTS FILE}
and its format is given with \telkey{RESULTS FILE FORMAT}.

If the \telkey{GEOMETRY FILE} is given in longitude-latitude, the result files
can also be written with the coordinates in longitude-latitude
by setting the keyword \telkey{RESULT FILE IN LONGITUDE-LATITUDE}
at YES (default value).


\subsection{The time series files}
Time series files are files (in SERAFIN or MED format), in which time series are
written for certain points in the domain of the simulation.
This feature has been introduced since release 8.5.
In this way, one can obtain results with a high time frequency, without using
a large amount of disk space.
The time series file module interpolates data (using linear interpolation
even if using quasi-bubble or quadratic elements)
to the required output coordinates.
\begin{itemize}
\item \telkey{TIME SERIES FILE 1} The name of the output file to write.
The time and coordinates correspond to those given in
\telkey{TIME SERIES COORDINATES FILE 1},
\item \telkey{TIME SERIES FILE 2} The name of the output file for time and
coordinates given in \telkey{TIME SERIES COORDINATES FILE 2},
\item \telkey{TIME SERIES FILE 1 FORMAT} The file format of
\telkey{TIME SERIES FILE 1} (single or double precision SERAFIN, or MED,
default = SERAFIN),
\item \telkey{TIME SERIES FILE 2 FORMAT} The file format of
\telkey{TIME SERIES FILE 2} (single or double precision SERAFIN, or MED,
default = SERAFIN),
\item \telkey{TIME SERIES COORDINATES FILE 1} The file which contains the output
times and output coordinates for \telkey{TIME SERIES FILE 1}.
The format is described next,
\item \telkey{TIME SERIES COORDINATES FILE 2} The file which contains the output
times and output coordinates for \telkey{TIME SERIES FILE 2}.
\end{itemize}

The \telkey{TIME SERIES COORDINATES FILE} has following format:
\begin {itemize}
\item On the first line, there are two numbers indicating:
\begin{itemize}
\item The number of time periods for which data is written to the
\telkey{TIME SERIES FILE},
\item The number of coordinates for which output is generated.
\end {itemize}
\item On the next lines, for each output period, there are three numbers
indicating:
\begin{itemize}
\item Start of the output period (in seconds since the start of the computation),
\item End of the output period (in seconds since the start of the computation),
\item Output time interval (in seconds).
\end {itemize}
\item For each coordinate, three numbers and a string, containing respectively:
\begin{itemize}
\item $x$-coordinate of the output point,
\item $y$-coordinate of the output point,
\item Unique ID of each station (in order to easily encounter the output
data in the output files).
This ID will be written to the IKLE array in the output file, which has a size
[NPOINTS $\times$ 1].
Note that the time series file consists of a list of points.
There is no mesh information in a time series file.
Therefore, the length of the IKLE array is the same as the number of points in
the time series file,
\item The name of the station (for better readability of the coordinate file).
\end{itemize}
\item Anything after the list of coordinates is considered comment and ignored
by \tel.
\end {itemize}

An example of a \telkey{TIME SERIES COORDINATES FILE} is given below.

\begin{verbatim}
2 3
0 100 10
500 1000 20
250  175     01 output_point_01
500  175     02 output_point_01
750  175     03 output_point_02

Description of the file
1st line: number of periods and number of points
2nd line: period 1: start time, end time and interval (in seconds)
3rd line: period 2: start time, end time and interval (in seconds)
4th-6th line: output points; x and y coordinates, unique ID, and station name
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{The listing printout}

This is a formatted file created by \telemac{2D} during the computation.
It contains the report of a \telemac{2D} running.
Its contents vary according to the values of the following keywords:

\begin{itemize}

\item \telkey{NUMBER OF FIRST TIME STEP FOR LISTING PRINTOUTS}:
this is used to indicate at what time step to begin printing information,
so as to avoid having excessively large files,
in particular when a stabilisation period precedes a transient simulation.
The default value is 0 (writing of the listing printouts at the
beginning of the simulation),

\item \telkey{LISTING PRINTOUT PERIOD}:
this sets the period between two time step printings.
The value is given in numbers of time steps.
By default, it is equal to 1, i.e. every time step.
For instance, the following sequence:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelemacCas]
\telkey{TIME STEP = 30}.
\telkey{LISTING PRINTOUT PERIOD = 2}
\end{lstlisting}

Prints the output listing every minute of simulation.
Moreover, irrespective of the period indicated by the user,
the last time step is systematically printed,

\item \telkey{LISTING FOR PRINTOUT PERIOD}:
this sets the period between two time step printings.
The value is given in numbers of time steps.
By default, it is equal to 1, i.e. every time step.
If this keyword is present in the steering file,
its value has priority to \telkey{LISTING PRINTOUT PERIOD}.

\item \telkey{LISTING PRINTOUT}:
this cancels the listing printout if the value is NO
(the listing printout then only contains the program heading and normal end
indication).
However, this is not advisable in any circumstances.

\item \telkey{VARIABLES TO BE PRINTED}:
this is used to specify the list of variables for which all values
will be printed at each mesh point.
This is a debugging option offered by \telemac{2D} that should be handled
with caution so as to avoid creating an excessively large listing printout,

\item \telkey{MASS-BALANCE}:
if this is required, the user will get information on the mass fluxes
(or rather volumes) in the domain at each printed time step.
This is not done by default,

\item \telkey{INFORMATION ABOUT SOLVER}:
if this is required, at each printed time step, the user will have the number
of iterations necessary to achieve the accuracy required during
solving of the discretized equations, or by default that reached at the end
of the maximum number of iterations authorized,

\item \telkey{INFORMATION ABOUT K-EPSILON MODEL}:
if this is required, at each printed time step, the user will have
the number of iterations necessary to achieve the accuracy required
during computation of the diffusion and source terms of the $k$-$\epsilon$
transport equations,
or by default that reached at the end of the maximum number of iterations
authorized.

The name of this file is directly managed by the \telemac{2D} start-up procedure.
In general, it has the name of the steering file and number of the processors
that ran the calculation, associated with the suffix .sortie.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{The auxiliary files}

Other files may be used by \telemac{2D}.
Using these files will most often require an implementation in FORTRAN.
Details on their logical units in FORTRAN are given below.

\subparagraph{Auxiliary files}

Other files may be used by \telemac{2D}:
\begin{itemize}
\item One or two binary data files, specified by the keywords
\telkey{BINARY DATA FILE 1} and \telkey{BINARY DATA FILE 2}.
These files can be used to provide data to the program, with the user
of course managing reading within the FORTRAN program using
the \telfile{GET\_FREE\_ID} subroutine,
the \telfile{T2DBI1} logic unit for binary data file 1 and the \telfile{T2DBI2}
logic unit for binary data file 2.
%(logical units gotten with 24 and 25).

\item One or two formatted data files, specified by the keywords
\telkey{FORMATTED DATA FILE 1} and \telkey{FORMATTED DATA FILE 2}.
These files can be used to provide data to the program, with the user
of course managing reading within the FORTRAN program using
the \telfile{GET\_FREE\_ID} subroutine,
the \telfile{T2DFO1} logic unit for formatted data file 1
and the \telfile{T2DFO2} logic unit for formatted data file 2.
%(logical units 26 and 27).

\item A binary results file specified by the keyword
\telkey{BINARY RESULTS FILE}.
This file can be used to store additional results (for example the trajectories
followed by floats when these are required).
Write operations on the file are managed by the user in the FORTRAN program
using the \telfile{GET\_FREE\_ID} subroutine and
the \telfile{T2DRBI} logic unit.
%(logical unit 28).

\item A formatted results file specified by the keyword
\telkey{FORMATTED RESULTS FILE}.
This file can be used to store additional results
(for example results that can be used by a 1D simulation code when two models
are linked).
Write operations on the file are managed by the user in the FORTRAN program
using the \telfile{GET\_FREE\_ID} subroutine and
the \telfile{T2DRFO} logic unit.
%(logical unit 29).
\end{itemize}

Read and write operations on these files must be managed completely by the user.
That management can be done from any point accessible to the user.
For example, using a file to provide the initial conditions will mean managing
it with the \telfile{CONDIN} subroutine or the subroutines called by it
(e.g.: \telfile{USER\_CONDIN\_H}).
Similarly, using a file to introduce boundary conditions can be done
in the \telfile{USER\_BORD} subroutine.

\telemac{2D} can also use other files when using harmonic constants databases.
These files are described in detail in Section \ref{subs:tidal:harm:datab}.


%\subparagraph{Logical units}

% Logical units have been parameterized because they may change in case of code coupling (for example two coupled programs may require the logical unit 1 and this would generate a conflict). All files have a number which is parameterized and constant :

%\begin{itemize}
%\item BINARY DATA FILE 1: T2DBI1 = 24
%\item BINARY DATA FILE 2: T2DBI2 = 25
%\item FORMATTED DATA FILE: T2DFO1 = 26
%\item FORMATTED DATA FILE: T2DFO2 = 27
%\item FORMATTED RESULT FILE: T2DRFO = 29
%\end{itemize}

All the logical units are stored in a structure called \telfile{T2D\_FILES}.
The logical unit of \telkey{BINARY DATA FILE 1}, for instance,
will be \telfile{T2D\_FILES(T2DBI1)\%LU}.

\begin{WarningBlock}{Note:}
 In some subroutines, it will be necessary to add
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
  USE DECLARATIONS_TELEMAC2D, ONLY: T2D_FILES, T2DBI1
\end{lstlisting}
 for example, to have access to the logical units of files.
\end{WarningBlock}

\subsection{The dictionary file}
\label{subs:dico:file}

This file contains all information on the keywords (name in French,
name in English, default values, type and documentation on keywords).
This file can be consulted by the user but must under no circumstances be
modified.


\subsection{Topographic and bathymetric data}
\label{subs:topo:bathy:data}
Topographic and bathymetric data may be supplied to \telemac{2D} at three
levels:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Either directly in the \telkey{GEOMETRY FILE} by a topographic
or bathymetric value associated with each mesh node.
In this case, the data are processed while the mesh is being built using
SALOME-HYDRO, Janet, Blue Kenue or MATISSE,
or when \stbtel is run before \telemac{2D} is started.
\stbtel reads the information in one or more bottom topography files (5 at most)
and interpolates at each point in the domain,

\item Or in the form of a cluster of points with elevations that have
no relation with the mesh nodes, during the \telemac{2D} computation.
\telemac{2D} then makes the interpolation directly with the same algorithm as
\stbtel.
The file name is provided by the keyword \telkey{BOTTOM TOPOGRAPHY FILE}.
Unlike \stbtel, \telemac{2D} only manages one single bottom topography file.
This file consists of three columns X, Y, Z,

\item Or using the \telfile{USER\_CORFON} subroutine (see section
\ref{sec:mod:bott:topo}).
This is usually what is done for schematic test cases.
\end{enumerate}

In all cases, \telemac{2D} offers the possibility of smoothing the bottom
topography in order to obtain a more regular geometry.
The smoothing algorithm can be iterated several times depending on the degree of
smoothing required.
The keyword \telkey{BOTTOM SMOOTHINGS} then defines the number of iterations
carried out in the \telfile{CORFON} subroutine.
The default value of this keyword is 0 (see also programming of the
\telfile{CORFON} subroutine in section \ref{sec:mod:bott:topo}).
This smoothing preserves volumes.


\subparagraph{Dykes modelling}

Dykes representation requires special attention from the modeler.
To properly handle the flow behavior at the dykes level
(including the apparition of overflow phenomena), it is necessary to provide
a minimum discretization of the cross sections of these dykes.
As shown in the figure below, this discretization should be based on
a minimum of 5 points (generally corresponding to 5 constraints lines in the
mesh generation tool):

\includegraphics*[width=2.91in, height=1.39in, keepaspectratio=false]{./graphics/dyke.png}

2 points representing the base of the dyke, 2 points representing the ends of
the upper level of the dyke and an extra point, slightly above the middle of the dyke.


This latter point allows, when the sides of the dyke are half wet,
to avoid the apparition of a parasitic flow over the dyke if the water level at
the highest point, calculated by the tidal flat algorithms, is not strictly zero.

Despite the care taken in meshing and the quality of the algorithms developed
within \telemac{2D}, there are sometimes parasitic overflows over some dykes
(the presence of water on the crest of the dyke whereas the surrounding free
surface is located below that level).
This is sometimes due to insufficient spatial discretization around dykes,
or because of the influence of inertia phenomena overvalued by the code
given that the dykes slopes could be too low compared to reality
(the size of the elements generally prevents to respect these slopes).
To handle this type of situation, a specific treatment algorithm has been
implemented in \telemac{2D}.
This allows to automatically perform a receding procedure when the water level
on the crest of the dyke is less than a threshold set by the user
and that the slope of the free surface at the dyke is too high.
This threshold, typically of a few millimeters to a few centimeters
is set using the keyword \telkey{THRESHOLD DEPTH FOR RECEDING PROCEDURE}
(expressed in meters and whose default value is 0~m).
It is recommended to use this algorithm with convection schemes
that ensures a perfect mass conservation.
It is also compatible with a correct treatment of the convection of tracers.
If necessary, the user can refer to the subroutine \telfile{RECEDING}.

Note that release 7.0 of \telemac{2D} allows taking into account the phenomena
of dyke failure.
This function is described in detail in Section \ref{sec:dykes}.

\subsection{Files dedicated to \nestor}

When using the module \nestor to carry out dredge or dump activities, these
files are used to specify the action, location, geometry and the last status.
The keywords identifying these files are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \telkey{NESTOR ACTION FILE},

\item \telkey{NESTOR POLYGON FILE},

\item \telkey{NESTOR SURFACE REFERENCE FILE},

\item \telkey{NESTOR RESTART FILE}.
\end{itemize}

These files are described in detail in the \nestor User Manual.
