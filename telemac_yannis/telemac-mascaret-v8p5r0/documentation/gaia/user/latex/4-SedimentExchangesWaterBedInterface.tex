The unified framework proposed for sediment transport processes in 2D and 3D eliminates unnecessary code duplication. Within this new code structure, the dimensionless entrainment rate of bed sediment into suspension per unit bed area per unit time $E$ is computed by the same subroutine for both 2D and 3D dimensions. As in \textsc{Sisyphe}, for non-cohesive and cohesive sediments the dimensionless entrainment and deposition rates are computed for each sediment class following the formulae of~\cite{wu2007computational} and~\cite{partheniades1965erosion,krone1962flume}, respectively. %/only in 2D CRITICAL SHEAR STRESS FOR DEPOSITION = 1.e4
