\chapter{BIOMASS Module}

The BIOMASS module is a water quality module which allows the calculation of algal biomass.
It estimates the extent of vegetal colonization in terms of various parameters:
sunlight, water temperature, fertilization degree, water renewal ratio,
water turbidity and toxicity \cite{gosse_biomass_1983}.
The BIOMASS module is activated by setting \telkey{WATER QUALITY PROCESS} = 3.

It takes into account five tracers:

\begin{itemize}
\item phytoplankton biomass PHY,
\item the principal nutrients influencing its production (phosphorus, nitrogen)
  as well as the associated mineral forms, namely:

\begin{itemize}
\item dissolved mineral phosphorus assimilable by phytoplankton PO$_4$,
\item degradable phosphorus not assimilable by phytoplankton POR,
\item dissolved mineral nitrogen assimilable by phytoplankton NO$_3$,
\item degradable nitrogen not assimilable by phytoplankton NOR.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

These variables are all expressed in mg/l except biomass that is expressed in $\mu$g(Chlorophyl a)/l.\\

The following sections explain the internal source terms.

For more details about the theory of the O2 module,
the reader can refer to the \waqtel technical manual.


\section{Processes represented}

The bottom and the processes that occur there are not modeled in the BIOMASS model.
Deposition is only represented by the deposition flux and,
once organic matter is deposited,
it no longer appears in the equations and can no longer be resuspended.
These deposition fluxes therefore correspond to a definitive loss of mass.


\section{Phytoplankton}

\subsection{Algal growth}

The algal growth rate $CP$ (d$^{-1}$) is given by:

\begin{equation*}
  CP = C_{max} RAY g_1 LNUT \alpha_1,
\end{equation*}

with $C_{max}$ = maximum algal growth rate at 20$^{\circ}$C;
one can set its value with the keyword \telkey{MAXIMUM ALGAL GROWTH RATE AT 20C} (default = 2).
$RAY$ represents the effect of sunlight on algal growth,
this dimensionless parameter ranges between 0 and 1.
$g_1 = T/20$ represents the effect of temperature on algal growth.
$LNUT$ represents the effects of phosphoric and nitric nutrients on algal growth.
$\alpha_1$ = water toxicity coefficient for algae ($\alpha_1$ = 1 in the absence of toxicity),
this last value can be chosen with the 1$^{\textrm{st}}$ value of the keyword
\telkey{ALGAL TOXICITY COEFFICIENTS} (default = 1).\\
$RAY$ is calculated by the Smith formula averaged over the vertical:

\begin{equation*}
  RAY = \frac{1}{k_e h} \log \left( \frac{I_0 + \sqrt{IK^2+I_0^2} }{ I_h + \sqrt{IK^2+I_h^2} }  \right),
\end{equation*}

where $k_e$ is the extinction coefficient of solar rays in water.
The formula to compute $k_e$ can be chosen with the keyword
\telkey{METHOD OF COMPUTATION OF RAY EXTINCTION COEFFICIENT} (default = 1):
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1: Atkins formula, it is calculated either by the Secchi depth $Z_s$
(keyword \telkey{SECCHI DEPTH}, default = 0.9~m, if it is a constant value),
    %$k_e$ = 1.7/$Z_s$,
  \item 2: the Moss relation: $k_e$ = $k_{pe}$+$ \beta $ [PHY] if $Z_s$ is unknown,
    where $k_{pe}$ is the coefficient of vegetal turbidity without phytoplankton
    provided with the keyword \telkey{VEGETAL TURBIDITY COEFFICIENT WITHOUT PHYTO}
    (default = 0~m$^{-1}$)
    and $\beta$ the Moss coefficient ($\beta \approx$ 0.015),
  \item 3: constant given by the user with the keyword
    \telkey{LIGHT EXTINCTION COEFFICIENT} (default = 0.2~m$^{-1}$).
\end{itemize}

$IK$ is a calibrating parameter
associated to the keyword \telkey{PARAMETER OF CALIBRATION OF SMITH FORMULA}
(default = 120~W/m$^2$) of an order of magnitude 100.
$I_0$ is the flux density of solar radiation on the surface
which can be set with the keyword \telkey{SUNSHINE FLUX DENSITY ON WATER SURFACE}
(default = 0~W/m$^2$)
and $I_h$ is the flux density of solar radiation at the bed bottom (W/m$^2$), calculated as:

\begin{equation*}
  I_h = I_0 \exp (-k_e h).
\end{equation*}

$LNUT$ is calculated by the formula:

\begin{equation*}
  LNUT = \min \left( \frac{[PO_4]}{KP+[PO_4]}, \frac{[NO_3]}{KN+[NO_3]} \right),
\end{equation*}

with $KP$ = phosphate half-saturation constant
set with the keyword \telkey{CONSTANT OF HALF-SATURATION WITH PHOSPHATE}
(default = 0.005 mgP/l),
and $KN$ = nitrate half-saturation constant
set with the keyword \telkey{CONSTANT OF HALF-SATURATION WITH NITROGEN}
(default = 0.03~mgN/l).\\

\subsection{Algal disappearance}

The algal disappearance rate $DP$ (d$^{-1}$) is given as:

\begin{equation*}
  DP = (RP+MP) g_2,
\end{equation*}

with $RP$ = algal biomass respiration rate at 20$^{\circ}$C
given by the keyword \telkey{RESPIRATION RATE OF ALGAL BIOMASS}
(default = 0.05~d$^{-1}$),
$MP$ = algal biomass disappearance rate at 20$^{\circ}$C (d$^{-1}$).
$g_2 = T/20$ represents the effect of temperature on algal disappearance.
$MP$ is given by the following relation:

\begin{equation*}
  MP = M_1 + M_2 [PHY] + \alpha_2,
\end{equation*}

with $M_1$ and $M_2$ = algal mortality coefficients at 20$^{\circ}$C
which can be set with the keyword
\telkey{COEFFICIENTS OF ALGAL MORTALITY AT 20C} (default = (0.1;0.003)),
$\alpha_2$ = water toxicity coefficient for algae,
this last value can be chosen with the 2$^{\textrm{nd}}$ value of the keyword
\telkey{ALGAL TOXICITY COEFFICIENTS} (default = 0).

\section{Nitric and phosphoric nutrients}

The following physical and biochemical parameters are used
to describe the processes influencing the evolution of nitric and phosphoric nutrients:

\begin{itemize}
\item \telkey{PROPORTION OF PHOSPHORUS WITHIN PHYTO CELLS}
  for the average proportion of phosphorus in the cells of living phytoplankton $fp$ (0.0025~mgP/$\mu$gChlA),
\item \telkey{PERCENTAGE OF PHOSPHORUS ASSIMILABLE IN DEAD PHYTO}
  for the proportion of directly assimilable phosphorus in dead phytoplankton $dtp$ (default = 0.5),
\item \telkey{RATE OF TRANSFORMATION OF POR TO PO4}
  for transformation rate of POR into PO$_4$ through bacterial mineralization $k_1$ (default = 0.03~d$^{-1}$),
\item \telkey{RATE OF TRANSFORMATION OF NOR TO NO3}
  for transformation rate of NOR into NO$_3$ through heterotrophic
  and autotrophic bacterial mineralization $k_2$ (default = 0~d$^{-1}$),
\item \telkey{PROPORTION OF NITROGEN WITHIN PHYTO CELLS}
  for the average proportion of directly assimilable nitrogen in living phytoplankton $fn$ (0.0035~mgN/$\mu$gChlA),
\item \telkey{PERCENTAGE OF NITROGEN ASSIMILABLE IN DEAD PHYTO}
  for the proportion of directly assimilable nitrogen in dead phytoplankton $dtn$ (default = 0.5),
\item $F_{POR}$: deposition flux of non-algal organic phosphorus (g/m$^2$/s).
  $F_{POR} = W_{POR} [POR]$,
  $W_{POR}$ is the sedimentation velocity of non-algal organic phosphorus
  given by the keyword \telkey{SEDIMENTATION VELOCITY OF ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS}
  (default = 0~m/s),
\item $F_{NOR}$: deposition flux of non-algal organic nitrogen (g/m$^2$/s).
  $F_{NOR} = W_{NOR} [NOR]$, $W_{NOR}$ is the sedimentation velocity of non-algal organic nitrogen
  given by the keyword \telkey{SEDIMENTATION VELOCITY OF NON ALGAL NITROGEN}
  (default = 0~m/s).
\end{itemize}

\begin{WarningBlock}{Warning:}
Since release 8.5 and as long as no good solution to implement the treatment of
sedimentation velocities (N and P) is found, this treatment has
been commented in the source code so that it is not possible to take them into
account \emph{in 3D}.
Thus keywords \telkey{SEDIMENTATION VELOCITY OF ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS} and
\telkey{SEDIMENTATION VELOCITY OF NON ALGAL NITROGEN} are not taken into account.
The behaviour is as they would be let to default value = 0~m/s.
\end{WarningBlock}
