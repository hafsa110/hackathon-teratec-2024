\chapter{Degradation law}

%\waqtel simulates the evolution of one or several tracer(s)
%over time from an initial condition according to a degradation law
%that is assumed to be of 1$^{\rm{st}}$ order (i.e. a tracer decrease).

\waqtel can simulate usual laws for bacterial degradation with
$T_{90}$ coefficient(s):
time(s) required for 90\% of the initial bacterial population to disappear
or also described as the time for bacterial or viral concentration to decrease
by one log unit (hence the 2.3 coefficient below).
It is expressed in hours.

In other words, it simulates the evolution of tracer(s) $C$ over time from
initial condition(s) according to a degradation law assumed to be of
1$^{\rm{st}}$ order (i.e. a tracer decrease) with constant(s) of tracer kinetic
degradation equal to $\frac{2.3}{T_{90}}$:

\begin{equation}
  F([C]) = -\frac{2.3}{T_{90}} [C],
\end{equation}

with $T_{90}$ coefficient(s) described above, in hours.
\\

\waqtel can also simulate the evolution of tracer(s) $C$ over time
from initial condition(s)
according to a degradation law that is assumed to be of 1$^{\rm{st}}$ order
(i.e. a tracer decrease):

\begin{equation}
  F([C]) = -k_1 [C],
\end{equation}

where $k_1$ is the constant (or one of the constants) of tracer kinetic
degradation $C$ (it can be given in h$^{-1}$ or d$^{-1}$).
\\

The user can decide whether a tracer follows such laws
with the keyword \telkey{LAW OF TRACERS DEGRADATION}
which is an array containing as many values as the number of tracers.
Possible choices are:
\begin{itemize}
\item 0: no degradation (default),
\item 1: law for bacterial degradation with $T_{90}$ coefficient
in hours,
\item 2: degradation law of first order, constant of tracer kinetic
degradation in h$^{-1}$,
\item 3: degradation law of first order, constant of tracer kinetic
degradation in d$^{-1}$,
\item 4: law implemented by user (with the help of
\telfile{USER\_CALCS2D\_DEGRADATION} or \telfile{USER\_CALCS3D\_DEGRADATION}
subroutines in 2D or 3D).
\end{itemize}

%and the values 0 if no degradation or 1 if a decrease law
%of kind bactoriological is applied (default = 0).
%Thus, this keyword has to contain as many values as the number of tracers.

%Its constant of tracer kinetic degradation $k_1$ can be specified
%The 90~\% mortality time $T_{90}$ can be specified
The $T_{90}$ or $k_1$ coefficients can be specified
with the keyword \telkey{COEFFICIENT 1 FOR LAW OF TRACERS DEGRADATION}
(one per tracer, expressed in hours for law 1, in h$^{-1}$ for law 2,
in d$^{-1}$ for law 3).
