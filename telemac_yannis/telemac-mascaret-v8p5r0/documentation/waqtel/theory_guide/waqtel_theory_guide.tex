\chapter*{Abstract}
This technical manual is mainly based on the translation of the TRACER principle note
``Outil de simulation 1-D MASCARET V7.1. Module de qualit√© d'eau TRACER. Note de principe''
written by Kamal El Kadi Abderrezzak and Marilyne Luck in 2012
\cite{elkadi_tracer_2012} (ref: EDF R\&D-LNHE H-P73-2011-01786-FR).
It also includes the heat atmosphere exchange subsection of the \telemac{3D} theory guide.

TRACER is the transport and water quality module of the 1D free surface code MASCARET.
TRACER simulates the evolution of several coupled tracers
without retroaction on the flow with respect to hydraulic conditions,
boundary conditions, external sources and biochemical interactions between tracers.\\

This note contains an explanation of the method retained for solving the advection-dispersion equation,
and its application to water quality modeling.

All the processes existing in TRACER were implemented in \telemac{2D} and \telemac{3D} through
a new module called \waqtel between v7.0 and v7.2.
The following water quality modules are described:
\begin{itemize}
\item O$_2$ (dissolved oxygen, organic and ammonia loads),
\item BIOMASS (phytoplankton biomass and nutrients),
\item EUTRO (dissolved oxygen, phytoplankton biomass, nutrients, organic and ammonia loads),
\item MICROPOL (micropollutants and suspended matter),
\item THERMIC (water temperature),
\item degradation law.
\end{itemize}
A reference to the library documentation of the water quality and aquatic ecology model
AED2 is also given.

\chapter{Degradation law}

%WAQTEL simulates the evolution of a tracer $C$ over time from an initial condition
%according to a degradation law that is assumed to be of 1$^{\rm{st}}$ order (i.e. a tracer decrease):

%\begin{equation}
%  F([C]) = -k_1 [C],
%\end{equation}

%where $k_1$ is the constant of tracer kinetic degradation $C$ (d$^{-1}$),
%to be specified by the user.

\waqtel can simulate usual laws for bacterial degradation with
$T_{90}$ coefficient(s):
time(s) required for 90\% of the initial bacterial population to disappear
or also described as the time for bacterial or viral concentration to decrease
by one log unit (hence the 2.3 coefficient below).
It is expressed in hours.
%mortality rate(s) of 90~\% when 90~\% of bacteria die.

In other words, it simulates the evolution of tracer(s) $C$ over time from
initial condition(s) according to a degradation law assumed to be of
1$^{\rm{st}}$ order (i.e. a tracer decrease) with constant(s) of tracer kinetic
degradation equal to $\frac{2.3}{T_{90}}$:

\begin{equation}
  F([C]) = -\frac{2.3}{T_{90}} [C],
\end{equation}

with $T_{90}$ coefficient(s) described above, in hours.
%where $T_{90}$ the time when 90~\% of bacteria die, in hours.
\\

%\begin{WarningBlock}{Note:}
%  This is not
\waqtel can also simulate the evolution of tracer(s) $C$ over time
from initial condition(s)
according to a degradation law that is assumed to be of 1$^{\rm{st}}$ order
(i.e. a tracer decrease):

\begin{equation}
  F([C]) = -k_1 [C],
\end{equation}

where $k_1$ is the constant (or one of the constants) of tracer kinetic
degradation $C$ (it can be given in h$^{-1}$ or d$^{-1}$).

\chapter{Conclusion}

WAQTEL simulates the transport of several tracers in a river or the sea
(by resolution of the advection-diffusion equation) possibly coupled
(\textit{via} source terms of the equation).
\waqtel offers a structure that allows programming further water quality modules.\\

This technical manual first shows the method of resolving the convection-dispersion equation
and its application to water quality.\\

The water quality modules available in the WAQTEL tool library are described,
namely:

\begin{itemize}
\item O2: a simplified module for dissolved oxygen,
\item BIOMASS: a module for phytoplankton biomass,
\item EUTRO: a module for river eutrophication (dissolved oxygen and algal biomass),
\item MICROPOL: a module for heavy metals or radioelements,
  taking into account their interaction with fine sediments (suspended particulate matter),
\item THERMIC: a module for water temperature evolution under the influence of atmospheric fluxes,
\item AED2: the water quality and aquatic ecology model,
\item a degradation law.
\end{itemize}

%In the future, the following tasks are expected to be addressed:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item enabling simulation of tracer transport in a hydraulic network that involves floodways,
%\item enabling a distinction to be made between minor riverbeds and major riverbeds
%  in studies of water quality,
%\item finally, taking account of the presence of dead zones (dead/storage zones).
%  This may be useful for river applications during periods of low water.
%\end{itemize}
