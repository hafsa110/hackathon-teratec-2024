\section{List of useful subroutines}
\label{se:usefulsub}

 The following subroutines can be modified by the user:

\begin{itemize}
\item  USER\_ANACOS.f:  Specification of an analytical stationary current.

\item  USER\_ANAMAR.f:  Specification of an analytical tide (current and water level).

\item  USER\_ANAVEN.f:  Specification of an analytical wind.

\item  USER\_TOM\_CORFON.f:  Modification of bottom topography.

\item  USER\_CORRXY.f:  Modification of coordinates.

\item  USER\_CURRENT.f:  Currents file reading from a user-defined format.

\item  USER\_DUMP2D.f: To define a new output defined by the user. 

\item  USER\_LIMWAC.f:  Specification of the boundary conditions.

\item  USER\_TIDE.f:  Tide level file reading from a user-defined format.

\item  USER\_WIND.f:  Winds file reading from a user-defined format.
\end{itemize}

 When these subroutines are used, they should be integrated into the user's FORTRAN file, or directory, then modified.
