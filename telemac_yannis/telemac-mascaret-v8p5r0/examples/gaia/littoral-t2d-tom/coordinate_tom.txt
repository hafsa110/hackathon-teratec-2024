   Description of the file
1st line: number of periods and number of points
2nd line: period 1: start time, end time and interval (in seconds)
3rd-11th line: output points; x coordinate, y coordinate, station number, and station name

The x and y coordinate are used for linear interpolation.
The station number is an index, which is written to IKLE. (So you can easily know which station is in the output file)
The station name is not used by TELEMAC, but is to increase the readibility of this file.
The rest of the file are comments

This file is specially made to test whether a warning is given for coordinates outside mesh
